# Motion Sense
The Motion Sense database tracks workouts and exercises performed by athletes who are working with trainers. First, a trainer uses the database to plan a set of workouts for an athlete over a certain time period. Then, the athlete uses the database to log their completion of those workouts on particular days. Each workout is composed of a set of exercises, which allows for the planning and logging of each workout in great detail. Finally, the database is also designed to provide access to doctors who may be working with athletes recovering from injury.

This repository holds the code that was used to create this database. The front end for this database can be accessed at https://cs460.sou.edu/~thompsop1/motion_sense/index.html
